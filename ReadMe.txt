Model Notes

These model files were created to illustrate and document the features of a Galilean Telescope designed for use in an MRI scanner and
should not be taken as a ‘fully accurate' specification of the built design, which was ‘hand' engineered and developed over several iterative steps.
They were created and may be viewed using free open source FreeCad version 0.18 software available from: https://www.freecadweb.org.
Note: FreeCad 3D parametric modeler is in rapid active development and may not be stable on all platforms.

Please refer to the FreeCad documentation for installation and operating procedures.

Addons installed from FreeCad Addon Manager (Not needed to view the files).
- A2Plus
- Fasteners

Viewing and exploring the 3D models is straight forward and does not require much investment of time.
A two button mouse with centre wheel will give the best viewing results.

Install FreeCad 0.18
Open Individual *.FCStd files for viewing.
Recommend Selecting: View/Perspective View (for best 3D exploration).
